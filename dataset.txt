This file is a simple text file used to store some text snippets to be used in testing.
Any line of text in this file will be embedded and the generated embeddings compared against expected values.
For qualitative testing, this is not a good dataset, however this serves as a simple sanity check for the embedding generation functionality.
And for continuous testing of numerical stability of the embedding generation process.
You should not use this file to benchmark embedding quality.
Since the file is small, the embeddings may not be representative of real world usage.
